# Usefull things
- All pages are placed in "template" folder
- All content rendering starts with _index.js_ file first
- You deal with components (similar to JSX)
- Router it's peace of sh*t, I know it, and i'll fix it in next versions...
- You can write your own modules and make any corrections to the code if you need
- You can find README file with small description and explanation how it works in every module
